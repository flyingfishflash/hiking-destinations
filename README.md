## Appalachian Trail Destinations
### TN: Indian Grave Gap (S) to Rt 19E (N)
----
45 miles (Shuttle)

Unakas

- Indian Grave Gap
- Beauty Spot
- Unaka Mountain
- Low Gap
- Iron Mountain Gap
- Greasy Creek Gap

Roan Highlands

- Hughes Gap
- Roan High Knob Shelter (Highest on AT)
- Carver's Gap
- Overmountain Shelter
- Little Hump Mountain
- Hump Mountain

Offical AT map: Tennessee #1,2 - Damascus, VA southward to Indian Grave Gap.

There are several drop-off points between Indian Grave Gap and Carvers Gap that can be used to shorten the trip. In all cases you will be dropped off and hike back to: [Moutain Harbour Hostel](https://www.mountainharbour.info/home/shuttle).

Roan High Knob Shelter itself is not particularly inviting, but it's in a nice spot with water. While it's not technically permitted, you may wish to camp on Grassy Ridge on the north side of Carver's Gap. Take the marked side trail off the AT uphill. In the past I have eaten dinner at Roan High Knob Shelter then hiked the three miles over to Grassy Ridge for the night.

There are numerous absolutely gorgeous tenting opportunities past Overmountain Shelter, though they are rather exposed and can be windy. Depending on the weather, I often eat dinner at Overmountain and hike on to camp near Little Hump Mountain.

I can't vouch for areas south of Indian Grave Gap, but heading north, with the exception of the Grayson Highlands in VA, there's no equivalent to the extensive 360 degree views in the Roan highlands until you reach the White Mountains in New Hampshire.

### VA: Grayson Highlands
---
12 miles (Loop)

Grayson Highlands

- Wise Shelter
- Thomas Knob Shelter
- Mt Rogers (Highest Point in VA, no view)

Official AT map: VA #1 - VA/TN state line, north 60 miles.

Also pick up a more detailed map at Grayson Highlands park headquarters.

There are many of variations you could make around this loop. Add side trips to Thomas Knob Shelter, and Mt Rogers (highest point in VA or extend the loop out of the high country to include Old Orchard shelter and the Lewis Fork trail, etc.

A pretty good description of the tightest loop, staying in the high country, with accurate driving directions:  

[Hiking Project: Grayson Highlands Pine Mountain Loop](https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7051342/grayson-highlands-at-pine-mtn-loop)

Register with the park when you arrive. Park at the overnight backpacking lot, and take the spur trail up to the AT at Massie Gap.

I like to either hike up (S) to Thomas Knob shelter (~5m) or down (N) to Wise shelter (2m), depending on when I arrive, and then day hike the 12 mile loop. Thomas Knob shelter vicinity has superior views, but no firewood, and it will add a few miles to the trip.

There will not be solitude during this hike if you go on a weekend.

### VA: Mt Pleasant Wilderness Area / Spy Rock / The Priest
---
 18 miles (Out and Back or multiple vehicles)

 Mt. Pleasant Wilderness Area

- Cole Mountain (Bald)
- Hog Camp Gap (Parking)
- Tar Jacket Ridge
- Wolf Rocks
- Seeley-Woodsworth Shelter
- Fish Hatchery Trail (To Parking, Montebello VA)
- Spy Rock (Excellent views)
- The Priest Summit / Shelter

Official AT Map: VA #13, GW National Forest - Tye River to James River

There are a few options. Reviewing the AT map will reveal them. Most often I follow an itinerary similar to this: Day 1: Hog Camp Gap to Seeley-Woodsworth shelter. Day 2: Up to The Priest and back to Seeley-Woodsworth shelter. Day 3: Return to Hog Camp Gap, checkout Cole Mountain, maybe stay another night.

Alternately I've also parked in Montebello, and done some quick trips around the Priest / Spy Rock / Seeley-Woodworth shelter vicinity.

There's a few other short trails near Hog Camp Gap, up Mt. Pleasant, and a low route south to Cow Camp Gap shelter (south of Hog Camp Gap).

Overall just a pleasant and fairly remote area (though this may have changed in more recent years).

## Colorado Trail Destinations
### Silverton, CO to Durango, CO
---
74 miles (Shuttle)

Colorado Trail Segments 25-28

Trail Maps and Guidebooks: [CT Shop](https://coloradotrail.org/shop-colorado-trail-products/)

[Durango and Silverton Scenic Railroad](https://www.durangotrain.com/)

Durango has an airport, and you can fly there from Denver. I will say, when I went in July of 2014, this was a short but intense flight, and I said I wouldn't  do it again, and would rather drive from Denver instead. For what it's worth.

You can get a shuttle from the airport to a hotel in downtown Durango. The city is fairly walkable and I had no trouble walking to outfitters to pick up isobutane and other last minute supplies. 

I used the same shuttle service throughout while in Durango, anytime I needed a ride, which was only to and from the airport, and from the trailhead back into town at the end of my trip. I never needed to rent a vehicle. The company was [Buck Horn Limousine](https://buckhornlimousine.com/), and they were great.

From Durango, take the Durango and Silverton Scenic Railway to Silverton. Obtain a shuttle from Silverton to the Molas Pass trailhead (short ride) and begin your walk back to Durango. The shuttle company I used was [San Jaun Backcountry](https://www.sanjuanbackcountry.com/train-and-other-shuttles/). They got me to the trail head.

The hiking was just beautiful, not terribly difficult.  Except for some really dicey thunderstorms the first two days, the weather was excellent. All but the final 18 miles of the 74 mile section are between 10,000-12,500 feet. It took me five days to cover the miles, but I *really* pushed it the last two days once the trail was descending from the high country into more typical landscape towards Durango. 

It was also fairly cheap. Excluding gear upgrades, 11 days away cost just under $1500 in 2014.  

Would do again without hesitation.
